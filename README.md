# Turtle GUI Shake Game (Python)
A small interactive game built with Python Turtle graphics.  
The project is divided into two parts, each located in a separate folder. The first folder is about learning how to work with Turtle. The second folder is the actual game.

This project was created as part of my Python learning journey and focuses on GUI interaction, animation, and event handling using the Turtle module.

Example:

```bash
cd /snake_game
python main.py
```

## Learning Goals
